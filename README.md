# Datasets:
Two benchmark PolSAR datasets were utilized to assess the performance of the proposed method in this study. Oberpfaffenhofen and Barnaul.
Both datasets are provided in this repository. 
# Experimental Configuration
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700 CPU (2.90 GHz) and an NVIDIA GeForce 3060Ti GPU, utilizing PyTorch 3.8. 

# Results
To quantitatively measure the proposed method, three evaluation metrics are employed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA) and Cohen's Kappa (k). Also, Each class accuracy has been reported.
